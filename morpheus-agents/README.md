# Agents in NVIDIA Morpheus

Exploring the use of NVIDIA Morpheus for real-time cybersecurity anomaly detection using digital fingerprinting, with a focus on integrating agent-based orchestration.

## Features
- Digital fingerprinting model setup
- Stream-based anomaly detection
- Agent architecture placeholders for workflow automation

## Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Example
```bash
python src/anomaly_agent.py
```

## Next Steps
- Implement multi-agent coordination
- Integrate vector search for enriched anomaly context
- Expand dataset variety
